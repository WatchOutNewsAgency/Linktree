## How to Edit

Go to the links section in `config.yml` and add your links there. You can also edit the name, avatar, and other sections.
The below is an example of how to add a link under the links section:
```yaml
  - link:
      icon: "fa-solid fa-pen"
      text: "Form for Memoirs"
      url: "https://forms.gle/j8KBXHgGGb1tvN9Q6"
      alt: "Memoir Form"
      title: "Memoir Form"
      target: "_blank"
```
